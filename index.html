          Misinformation & related confusion and misunderstanding about
          important social and political problems. Promoting media literacy is a
          powerful way to deal with these problems by inviting consumers to a
          culture of informed & selective consumption where misinformation is
          condemned and ethical journalism is rewarded.

          Social and political polarization between groups in an increasingly
          polarizing social media environment. Advocating for media literacy
          produces better decision-makers who recognize the polarizing nature of
          social media platforms and are able to demonstrate compassion to
          others and genuine interest in the other opinion.

          Misuse of media is a major factor in problems like depression, social
          anxiety, and suicide. From individuals limiting time spent on social
          media to parents advisedly choosing content for their children, well-
          being and lifestyle can be improved through conscious media
          consumption.

          Democracy is always under threat, has to be protected, and never be
          taken granted for. It is directly dependent on free media. Today media
          is a powerful tool that is used in achieving democracy but also in
          hijacking it. Supporting media literacy is the ultimate way to protect
          democracy and raise informed audience gatekeepers.

            Better informed media users for a brighter future! We are interested
            in teaching conscious media consumption to all people. From
            individuals improving their lifestyle to a more educated populace,
            there is so much to achieve through studying how to better interact
            with different forms of media.

          Media literacy is not just important, it's absolutely critical. It's
          going to make the difference between whether kids are a tool of the
          mass media or whether the mass media is a tool for kids to use.
